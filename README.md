## Using this collection

### Installing the Collection from Ansible Galaxy

Before using this collection, you need to install it with the Ansible Galaxy command-line tool:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install splunk.enterprise
```

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: splunk.enterprise
```

Note that if you install the collection from Ansible Galaxy, it will not be upgraded automatically when you upgrade the `ansible` package. To upgrade the collection to the latest available version, run the following command:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install splunk.enterprise --upgrade
```

You can also install a specific version of the collection, for example, if you need to downgrade when something is broken in the latest version (please report an issue in this repository). Use the following syntax to install version `0.1.0`:

```bash
ansible-galaxy collection install splunk.enterprise:==0.1.0
```

See [using Ansible collections](https://docs.ansible.com/projects/ansible/devel/user_guide/collections_using.html) for more details.

### Using modules from the Splunk Enterprise collection in your playbooks

You can call modules by their Fully Qualified Collection Namespace (FQCN), such as `splunk.enterprise.splunk_universal_forwarder_linux`.
The following example task installs splunk universal forwarder on a RHEL machine that was specified in the inventory file, using the FQCN:

```yaml
---
- name: Install Splunk Universal Forwarder (x86_64)
  splunk.enterprise.splunk_universal_forwarder_linux:
    state: present
    version: "9.4.7"
    release_id: "2a9293b80994"
    username: admin
    password: "changeme123"
```

for Windows we would have the following inventory format:
```ini
[windows]
windows_server_22 ansible_host=<insert_server_22_ip>
windows_server_19 ansible_host=<insert_server_19_ip>
windows_server_25 ansible_host=<insert_server_25_ip>

[windows:vars]
ansible_user=Admin
ansible_password=<insert password>
ansible_connection=winrm
ansible_winrm_transport=basic
ansible_winrm_server_cert_validation=ignore
ansible_port=5985
```

for rhel an example of a suggested inventory:
```ini
[rhel8]
<insert_server_rhel8_ip>
[rhel9]
<insert_server_rhel9_ip>
[rhel10]
<insert_server_rhel10_ip>
[rhel]
<insert_server_rhel8_ip>
<insert_server_rhel9_ip>
<insert_server_rhel10_ip>
```
